to make the feedback work :
1-you should connect the WG and the oscilloscope and 
the PC to LAN and make sure they can comunicate (preferably same network)
2- search the IP adress for both your WG and oscilloscope (usually in I\O settings )\
3-change the numbers {132.68.57.40}oscilloscope_resource = 'TCPIP0::132.68.57.40::inst0::INSTR'(line 29) to the oscilloscope I.P
4- change the numbers {132.68.57.40}WG_adress = 'TCPIP0::132.68.57.39::inst0::INSTR'(line 39) to the WG I.P
for optimizer project with 48V output thats it just conect the circet  

if you want another output you should change the ranges in line 81 and 84 to what you want
